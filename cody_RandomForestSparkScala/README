How to run the code:
1. Install Intellij community version: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/
2. Install the Scala plugin when initially setting up Intellij, use this as a reference: https://www.supergloo.com/fieldnotes/intellij-scala-spark/.
   steps 1-4 go over the steps to installing the Scala plugin. The rest details how to import the spark libraries using SBT but I did not use that method.
3. Download Spark 2.2.0 from here: https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html. 1. Choose Spark release 2.2.0 (Jul 11 2017), 2. Choose a package type: Pre-built
   for Apache Hadoop 2.7 and later and on number 3. click the spark-2.2.0-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz
4. Extract spark-2.2.0-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz to your chosen destination such as "/home/cjordan"
5. Open this project in Intellij
6. Right click on the folder "RandomForestSparkScala" and select "Open Module Settings"
7. In the "Project Structure" pop-up window, select SDKs.
8. Add the path you selected in step 4 using the green "+" sign on the right of the list. This brings up another pop-up window, navigate to the spark bin
   extract path ("/home/cjordan/spark-2.2.0-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz/jars") and click on the first, scroll down and shift click on the last jar and hit "ok"
9. This should have added all the spark jars to Intellij's SDK path and allow you to navigate to the src folder and run "main"
